## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The purpose of this project was to help me review my knowledge of CSS. I was having some issues fixing a bug with the layout in one of my [React project](https://devscope-synergy.web.app/) so I decided to take some time of to experiment with vanilla js and CSS. Through this project I was able to understand where the error was coming from; it turns out it had to do with default behaviour of CSS.
